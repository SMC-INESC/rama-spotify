\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First, I would like to thank my supervisors, Fabien Gouyon and Matthew Davies.
Their guidance, focus and leadership allowed me to follow the right path to complete this thesis.

Second, I want to thank all of the members of the SMC group at INESC TEC and Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto, that helped me in any way.
The warm welcome to the group and their experience as researchers played an important role in this project.
Special thanks to Marcelo and Mohamed for their patience with my writing skills.

Third, I would like to thank all of the people that helped me with the experiments.
Their feedback was very insightful.
They were a motivation for me to develop this project.

Forth, a huge thank you to all of my friends who stood by my side when I needed them the most, with a special thanks to João, João, Artur and Sandra.
They showed more patience and love that a friend could ever ask for in these last few months.

I would also like to thank my beloved dog, Pipo. He showed compassion, patience and above all, unconditional love towards a tired and ranty friend.

And finally, a heart-warming thank you to my family.
Their patience, understanding, caring, compassion and most importantly, their love, allowed me to accomplish what I thought was impossible a few months ago.
I thank them from the bottom of my heart.
