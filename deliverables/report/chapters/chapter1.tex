\section{Context} \label{sec:context}


  Not so long ago, before the Internet boom, listening or discovering new music was a challenge on its own.
  Now, with a few clicks one can have on their hands such a vast music catalogue that a human mind is not able to compute.

  There is an uncountable number of music streaming services that offer exactly that\footnote{Although some of them require the users to subscribe to a monthly fee, for example, in order to fully use the service, or remove the advertisements.}.
  These services are, mostly, web based, although some offer desktop applications.
  They allow the users to play music, save their collection, create playlists and much more.
  Most of these services also have social components that allow the users to share what they're listening to with their friends, as well as playlists and much more.

  There is always something that makes a music streaming service different from the others.
  Some services focus on creation/generation of playlists (8tracks\footnote{\url{http://8tracks.com}}), others try to expand their music catalogue even further (Spotify\footnote{\url{http://spotify.com}}, Rdio\footnote{\url{rdio.com}}), while others focus more on personalized music recommendations (Pandora\footnote{\url{pandora.com}}).
  The latter ones, present their music recommendations to the user with a list or a grid of music artists, for example.
  However, lists do not provide the user enough information about the relation between the results \cite{Lamere2008}.
  One could even say that they are not related to each other, which is not true.
  
  The relations exist and can be represented as a network of interconnected artists in a graph, where a node is a music artist, and each edge between them represents a connection.
  This is the concept that RAMA (Relational Artist MAps), a project developed at INESC Porto, uses \cite{Costa2008} \cite{Sarmento2009} \cite{Costa2009} \cite{Gouyon2011}.

  The concept is not new, and in Chapter~\ref{chap:chap2} some services that use visual tools will be analysed in detail.


\section{Motivation and Goals} \label{sec:goals}

  From a single search, RAMA draws a graph that helps the user to explore new music that might caught his/her interest in a much more natural way.

  Nonetheless, when a user wants to listen to an artist's music, Youtube's stream is used.
  Although one can find a large catalogue of music in Youtube, this service is not music oriented and the sound quality is not adequate for a music streaming service.

  Youtube's stream needs to be replaced.
  From the available services that provide a vast music catalogue, Spotify\footnote{\url{http://spotify.com}} provides a good quality stream and a good developer support for creating Spotify powered Applications.

  But how can RAMA and Spotify be integrated? \\

  There are several possibilities that Spotify has made available for developers\footnote{\url{https://developer.spotify.com}} that can help to improve RAMA's concept.
  From websites, mobile applications, native applications and even plugins for the Spotify Desktop Client, Spotify's API is very complete.

  Given some limitations when using some APIs\footnote{for example, LibspotifySDK (\url{https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/}) requires the developer and the user of the application to have a premium account.}, there are several aspects to take into account when choosing which API to use. \\

  In the end, this dissertation proposes a Spotify Application\footnote{\url{https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps}} that works like a plugin to the Spotify's Desktop Client, i.e., it should add something to Spotify's Application.
  This is a very appealing solution: Spotify Users will have the chance to continue using Spotify as they normally would, but with an extra help to discover new music by using RAMA's application \emph{inside} Spotify. 
  This method works on the assumption that Spotify's music discovery mode can be improved using a visual tool.
  The reasons for the final decision will be explained with further detail in Chapter~\ref{chap:chap3}. \\

  This approach urges to answer the following question: Will a Spotify user experience a more pleasant and natural way of music discovery from this graphical representation of artist relations within Spotify, than its standard discovery mode (with lists)?

  To answer that question and to evaluate and validate the final prototype, end-user testing will be done to compare Spotify's user experience with the developed application.

\section{Project Requirements}
\label{sec:proj}

  This application is meant to be an extra mode for discovering new music in Spotify.

  This way, a visual representation of an artist network with a graph, similar to RAMA, is proposed.

  The application runs inside the Spotify environment (Spotify's Desktop Client) were its main features are: visualization of relations between artists; edition of the visualization parameters (branching and depth); edition of the graph by expanding and deleting the nodes; visualize tags/genres (that describe an artist) in the graph representation.

  The main tools used in the development of the application were:

  \begin{description}
    \item[Spotify Desktop Client] \hfill \\
      The developed application is integrated in the Spotify's desktop client.
    \item[Webkit Development Tools - webkit.org] \hfill \\
      This is the engine used to run Spotify Applications.
    \item[Npmjs - npmjs.org] \hfill \\
      Package manager for development dependencies.
    \item[Bower - bower.io] \hfill \\
      Package manager for runtime dependencies.
    \item[Gruntjs - gruntjs.com] \hfill \\
      Manager for automating tasks. Very usefull for tests, code optimization and other repetitive tasks.
    \item[Vis.js - visjs.org] \hfill \\
      Visualization framework.

\section{Dissertation Structure} \label{sec:struct}

  This dissertation contains four additional chapters.

  In chapter \ref{chap:chap2}, related works will be presented to evaluate the current state of the art.

  In chapter \ref{chap:chap3}, the project's details will be explained, starting with an introduction to the Spotify Apps' development environment and the role of the technologies used during the development of the prototype.

  In chapter \ref{chap:chap4}, a more detailed explanation about the developed prototype will be given, as well as some challenges and problems encountered during the development process.

  Chapter \ref{chap:chap5} concludes this report.
