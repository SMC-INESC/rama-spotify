\chapter{Implementation and Validation}
\label{chap:chap4}

\section*{}

In this chapter, further details about the prototype's main features and the methodologies used when developing the prototype, as well as in the the validation process, will be explored.

The Implementation section will go into details about the processes used to have a maintainable development environment by taking advantage of several tools that automated most of the common tasks. The main implemented features will also be analysed.
By this point, the validation of the prototype will be analysed, by explaining the performed user tests, as well the analysis of the results.

\section{Implementation} % (fold)
\label{sec:implementation}

    
  \subsection{Technologies used} % (fold)
  \label{sub:technologies}

    The following technologies were used during the development of the application.

    \subsubsection{Git} % (fold)
    \label{ssub:git}
    
    The chosen version control system to manage the source code was git\footnote{git: \url{http://git-scm.com}}. \\
    The use of branches\footnote{git branches: \url{http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-What-a-Branch-Is}} and tags\footnote{git tags: \url{http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging}} allowed for a manageable code development environment, e.g., marking release commits or working on experimental features.

    \subsubsection{Spotify Desktop Client} % (fold)
    \label{ssub:subsection_name}
      Spotify Applications are developed in its runtime environment - the Spotify Desktop Client.
      To open a Spotify Application, in the Desktop Client, one writes the following in the search bar: spotify:app:rama, where \emph{rama} is the application identifier declared in the \emph{manifest.json} file\footnote{file located at the root of the project folder}.

      Example:

      \lstinputlisting[caption={manifest.json: \emph{BundleIdentifier} is the application's identifier; \emph{Dependencies} declares the Application's API dependencies.}, style=htmlcssjs]{snippets/manifest.json}

      There are useful options for development located in the "Develop" tab (Figure~\ref{fig:html5_support}).

      \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{html5_support.pdf}
        \end{center}
        \caption{\emph{Develop} Tab}
        \label{fig:html5_support}
      \end{figure}

      The "Show Inspector" option opens the \emph{Webkit Development Tools} (\ref{ssub:webkit_tools}) window.

    \subsubsection{Webkit Development Tools - webkit.org} % (fold)
    \label{ssub:webkit_tools}

      Webkit provides a bundle of tools for web development.

      Being the most important:

      \begin{description}
        \item[Inspector] Allows the inspection of the resulting Html and CSS and edit the code and see the application automatically reflect those changes (Figure~\ref{fig:webkit_inspector}).
        \item[Network] Shows a timeline list of resources that where loaded from external sources (sometimes local) (Figure~\ref{fig:webkit_network}).
        \item[Profile] Allows the identification of which parts of the javascript code are being executed frequently, and which ones might be creating a performance issue (Figure~\ref{fig:webkit_profile}).
        \item[Audit] Helps clarify which CSS rules are not being used (Figure~\ref{fig:webkit_audit}).
        \item[Console] Javascript interpreter that also works as the log output for the application (Figure~\ref{fig:webkit_console}).
      \end{description}

    \subsubsection{Gruntjs - gruntjs.com} % (fold)
      \label{ssub:gruntjs}
        Gruntjs is a Javascript task runner.
        It allows the automation of most of the repetitive tasks when developing a website.
        This is very useful for testing, compiling and code optimization.

    \subsubsection{Npmjs - npmjs.org} % (fold)
    \label{ssub:npm}
      Npmjs is the package dependency manager for nodejs\footnote{nodejs: \url{http://nodejs.org}} - Node Packaged Modules.
      Node packages will be used, since Gruntjs plugins are all nodejs packages (as well as Grunt itself).
      An npm configuration file (\emph{package.json}) allows the identification of the packages that the application depends upon, as well as its versions.

      Example: 

      \lstinputlisting[caption={\emph{package.json}: "*" means that npm should always install the latest version of that package.}, style=htmlcssjs]{snippets/package.json}

      Note that these software packages are for development only. They are not needed at all when running production code.

    \subsubsection{Bower - bower.io} % (fold)
    \label{ssub:bower}
    
    Bower is also a package manager, but oriented for web front-end packages.
    It mainly supports runtime software packages, which are needed for production code.

    % subsection bower (end)

    \subsubsection{vis.js - visjs.org} % (fold)
    \label{ssub:visjs}
      Vis.js is a javascript framework for visualization.
      It provides a few visual components, including graphs.


  \subsection{Implemented Features} % (fold)
    \label{sub:main_features}
    
    The requirements for the prototype are as following:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Visualization of relations between artists by means of a visual tool;
      \item Editing of the visualization using several parameters;
      \item Editing of the graph by allowing to remove and add new nodes;
      \item Visualizing the tags/genres (that describe an artist) in the graph representation.
    \end{itemize}

    All of these features were implemented.

    \subsubsection{Visulization of the Artists Map} % (fold)
      \label{ssub:visualization}
    
      The application automatically draws the map with the current playing artist as the main node, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:graph_rootnode}.

      \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graph_rootnode.pdf}
        \end{center}
        \caption{The first drawn graph uses the current playing artist (lower left corner) as the root node.}
        \label{fig:graph_rootnode}
      \end{figure}

      The graph-like structure is created by recursively fetching a list of related artists from each artist. Once a certain pre-established limit of recursive levels is reached\footnote{depth value of a graph}, the algorithm stops.
      The graph creation algorithm is as follows:

      % TODO change the code to attachments
      \lstinputlisting[
        caption={Simplified graph creation algorithm in Javascript (duplicate nodes checking is encapsulated in the insertNode function)}, style=htmlcssjs
      ]
      {snippets/map_creation_alg.js}

      The maximum number of nodes that the graph might have, can be calculated as follows:

      \begin{equation}
          \sum_{i=0}^{d} b ^ i
      \end{equation}

      Where $d$ is the depth value and $b$ is the branching value of the graph.

      This algorithm, albeit simplified, represents the basic flow when constructing a graph, or more specifically, a tree.
      Since, in this case of study, the direction of the edges of the graph is not relevant in any way to the artists' map, all of the edges are considered to be undirected.

      Assuming that the insertNode() function checks for duplicate nodes, i.e., it only inserts unique nodes into the graph, then the resulting graph is one of a tree, since there are no simple cycles in the graph.
      An example of this behaviour can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:graph_treemode}.

      \begin{figure}[ht]
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{map_creation_treemode.pdf}
        \end{center}
        \caption{Graph created like a tree with "Red Hot Chilli Peppers" as the root node.}
        \label{fig:graph_treemode}
      \end{figure}

      This approach, however, is not showing all of the available information.
      Given this same example (Figure~\ref{fig:graph_treemode}), the artist node "Stone Temple Pilots" is a child of the node artist "Faith No More".
      The algorithm inserted the latter into the graph first.
      After that, when retrieving the childs of "Jane's Addiction", "Stone Temple Pilots" is contained in that list, and so the insertNode() function discards the node since it is a duplicate.
      This means that there is a connection between both of them that are being discarded.

      \paragraph{Graph's Tree Mode} \hfill \\
      To build a graph with all the connections that exist between all of the artists in the graph, the insertNode() function would need to insert the missing edge into the graph by analysing the current graph state.
      This method creates a graph by definition, while the previous one created a tree graph.
      An example of this behaviour can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:graph_notreemode}.

      \begin{figure}[ht]
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{map_creation_notreemode.pdf}
        \end{center}
        \caption{Graph created with all the connections with "Red Hot Chilli Peppers" as the root node.}
        \label{fig:graph_notreemode}
      \end{figure}

      \hfill \\
      \indent \emph{
      From now on, if the graph is a tree, it will be said that the algorithm is using the \emph{Tree Mode}.
      So the example in Figure~\ref{fig:graph_treemode} is a \emph{Tree Mode} example, and the examples in Figure~\ref{fig:graph_notreemode} and Figure~\ref{fig:graph_notreemode2} are not \emph{Tree Mode} examples\footnote{
        Note that, sometimes, even if the algorithm is not on tree mode, it might generate a tree, simply because there were no missing edges between the nodes to be added to the graph.
      }.}
      \hfill \\

      Note (Figure~\ref{fig:graph_notreemode}) how "Stone Temple Pilots" is now a child of both "Faith No More" and "Jane's Addiction".
      Also note that the same behaviour is visible with the nodes "Mad Season" and "Screaming Trees".

      At this point, the current user's perception of the artist "Stone Temple Pilots" might be different from the previous example (Figure~\ref{fig:graph_treemode}).
      These added connections are, in a way, clustering together the most connected nodes.
      In this particular example, one could see an improvement with this approach: it contributes to the user's understanding of the artist's network by making sure the user knows that those specific artists are more connected between them, than any others.
      Since only three extra edges where added, this means there is not much visual clutter in the visualization.
      However, that might not always be the case.

      One could argue that the "Mad Season" artist node is already disturbing the visual representation by being drawn over an edge.
      In fact, with the exact same values of branching, depth and tree mode off, when creating a graph for the artist "Mariza", the visual clutter is so strong that the graph becomes confusing and not very helpful: Figure~\ref{fig:graph_notreemode2}.

      \begin{figure}[tb]
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graph_notreemode2.pdf}
        \end{center}
        \caption{Graph created with all the connections with "Mariza" as the root node.}
        \label{fig:graph_notreemode2}
      \end{figure}

      The cluster of nodes in the center makes it clear that those specific nodes are really connected between them. 
      But then, the edges, that are forcing those nodes together, are creating a visual clutter that might not be desirable.
      Instead of creating a visual map of the artists' network for the user to  explore and change in his/her own way, the representation is more contained, static and not so visually appealing.
      \hfill \\

      So on one hand, the \emph{clustering} of the nodes seems like an interesting feature.
      It allows for a more complete understand of the underlying information of the related artists.
      But on the other hand, the focus of the visualization (to show a map of the artists' network) is shifting to this cluster-like representation.

      Both perspectives are advantageous depending on the data they are operating on (as seen in the previous examples).
      So instead of choosing only one method, both were chosen: by default, the graph creation algorithm is on tree mode, and the user can turn it off from a settings menu.
      This allows for the user to choose the visual representation method that suits his/her needs.

      \paragraph{Depth and Branching values} \hfill \\
      The depth and branching values have been mentioned before in this chapter, but not yet fully explained.

      The \textbf{depth} value of a graph determines how deep the recursive algorithm is.
      The previously presented example (Figure~\ref{fig:graph_treemode}) has a depth value of 2.
      The example in Figure~\ref{fig:graph_depth3} has a depth value of 3.
      \begin{figure}[hb]
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graph_depth3.pdf}
        \end{center}
        \caption{Graph with depth value of 3}
        \label{fig:graph_depth3}
      \end{figure}
      In short, depth is the maximum distance between the root node and any other node in the graph.

      The \textbf{branching} value of a tree graph determines the maximum number of child nodes a node can have.
      The example in Figure~\ref{fig:graph_treemode} has a branching value equal to 4.

    % subsubsection visualization (end)

    \subsubsection{Visualization Parameters} % (fold)
    \label{ssub:visualization_parameters}
    
    The visualization parameters are the branching and depth values, as well as the option to enable/disable the tree mode.
    To allow the user to change these values, a settings menu was added to the application, and can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:settings_menu}.
    When the user changes the parameters, the graph refreshes accordingly.

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{settings_menu.pdf}
      \end{center}
      \caption{The settings menu that allows the user to change the visualization parameters.}
      \label{fig:settings_menu} 
    \end{figure}

    % subsubsection visualization_parameters (end)

    \subsubsection{Graph Edition} % (fold)
      \label{ssub:edition}

      The available features to edit the graph are as follow: expand node, delete node and create a new map.
      These interactions are available in the Artist Menu (\ref{ssub:artist_info}).

      \paragraph{Expand node} \hfill \\
      This option allows the user to expand a node further (ignoring the graph's branching value).
      Given the previous example in Figure~\ref{fig:graph_treemode}, if the "Dispatch" node gets expanded, it results in Figure~\ref{fig:node_expanded}.
      To put it simply, to expand a node, one performs one iteration of the graph creation algorithm.

      \begin{figure}[tb]
         \begin{center}
           \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graph_expanded_node.pdf}
         \end{center}
         \caption{"Dispatch" artist node expanded.}
         \label{fig:node_expanded}
      \end{figure}

      \paragraph{Delete node} \hfill \\
      This options allows the user to delete a node from the graph.
      This is useful for when the user wants to construct the graph to his/her needs.

      \paragraph{New map} \hfill \\
      The user may choose to create a whole new graph from a another node.
      This way the root node will be the selected node.


    % subsubsection edition (end)

    \subsubsection{Artist Info} % (fold)
      \label{ssub:artist_info}
      The user is able to see additional information about artists in the Artist Menu (Figure~\ref{fig:artist_menu}) such as its popularity value, albums and tags, as well as perform the \emph{expand} and \emph{new map} functions described in \ref{ssub:edition}.
      \begin{figure}[tb]
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{artist_menu.pdf}
        \end{center}
        \caption{Artist Menu with information about "Chris Cornell"}
        \label{fig:artist_menu}
      \end{figure}
      When the user selects a node by clicking on it, the artist menu updates the displayed information.

      The \emph{popularity} and the \emph{albums} are metadata information retrieved from Spotify's API framework (\ref{sub:spotify_apps}).
      The tags, however, are not supported by Spotify's API.
      For that, Echonest's API\footnote{Echonest's API: \url{http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4}} was used.

      \paragraph{Echonest's Terms} \hfill \\
      Echonest's tags are very similar to the most commonly known \emph{music genres} (like jazz, country, rock), but they also might include more alternative descriptive terms (progressive metal, symphonic, soundtrack).

      The connection between the two APIs is possible thanks to the Project Rosetta Stone\footnote{\url{http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4\#project-rosetta-stone}}.
      For example, to retrieve the terms\footnote{Echonest calls it terms. From now on, terms and tags will be used interchangeably} of an artist from Echonest's metadata API using the Spotify's Artist ID, the following query is used: \\

      \url{
        http://developer.echonest.com/api/v4/artist/terms?api_key=API_KEY&format=json&sort=weight&id=spotify-WW:artist:65nZq8l5VZRG4X445F5kmN
      } \\

      The \emph{id} parameter is similar to the Spotify's URI scheme (\ref{sub:metadata_api}), and this allows for retrieving extra information about the artist that Spotify's API does not provide.

      \emph{Sort} is another interesting parameter. 
      In general, artists have more than 10 or 15 terms.
      Each term has a value of \emph{frequency} and a value of \emph{weight}, and both are float values that range between zero and one.
      No official documentation was found to explain what do these values represent, but Paul Lamere\footnote{Paul Lamere is Director of Developer Platform at \url{the.echonest.com} (\url{http://the.echonest.com/company}). He also blogs here: \url{http://musicmachinery.com}} explains\footnote{thread in the forum for Echonest's API users - \url{http://developer.echonest.com/forums/thread/353}} that:

      \begin{quote}
      \emph{
        term frequency is directly proportional to how often that term is used to describe that artist
      }
      \end{quote}

      \begin{quote}
      \emph{
        term weight is a measure of how important that term is in describing the artist
      }
      \end{quote}

      So given this, one can conclude that by sorting the terms of an artist by its frequency value, the top terms will be more general (rock, pop, jazz) and not very descriptive or specific of an artist.
      And by sorting the tags by weight, one will get the most descriptive tags of that specific artist.
      Clearly, in this case, for the Artist Menu the weight parameter is very helpful, and so, the sort parameter used for the query is \emph{weight}.
      As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:artist_menu}, the tags shown are very descriptive of the artist (grunge, 80s, hard rock).

    % subsubsection artist_info (end)

    \subsubsection{Tags Overlay} % (fold)
      \label{ssub:tags_overlay}

      The tags overlay menu (Figure~\ref{fig:tags_overlay}) is meant to enhance the user's understanding on the displayed artists' nodes regarding their tags.
      \begin{figure}[tb]
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{tags_overlay.pdf}
        \end{center}
        \caption{Tags overlay for the displayed graph. When the tag "grunge" is selected the corresponding artist nodes are selected}
        \label{fig:tags_overlay}
      \end{figure}
      These tags are the same ones used in the Artist Menu (Figure~\ref{fig:artist_menu}).
      They are selectable, and so, when clicked, the respective artist nodes that are described by those tags, are highlighted (as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:tags_overlay}).

      The tags shown in this menu, are just a small sample of the artists' tags of the whole graph.
      For example, for the graph in the Figure~\ref{fig:graph_anamanaguchi}, the total count of unique tags in the whole graph is 93.
      To select which tags to show, those same 93 tags were sorted by frequency in the graph, and then the top 12 ones are shown.

      This way, the tags in the overlay are significant for the graph, by helping the user to visually group together some related artists.

      \begin{figure}
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graph_anamanaguchi.pdf}
        \end{center}

  \subsection{Development Processes} % (fold)
    \label{sub:development_process}

    The main objectives for the RAMA Spotify Application were to implement the basic functionalities that RAMA's website\footnote{\url{http://rama.inescporto.pt/app}} offers.
    Incrementally, they were implemented, tested and added to the application.
    A timeline (chronological order from bottom to top) with the added features (each update release) can be seen in \\ 
    \indent \url{https://github.com/carsy/rama-spotify/releases} \\

    An overview of pushed commits can be viewed in Figure~\ref{fig:code_contributions}.

    \begin{figure}[H]

        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{code_contributions.pdf}

      \caption{Graph showing the number of commits to the project from January to June, 2014. All of the development code was hosted in \url{Github.com}. Adapted from \url{https://github.com/carsy/rama-spotify/graphs/contributors}}
      \label{fig:code_contributions}
    \end{figure}

    Unit tests were added for each feature.
    The tests were run locally to ensure that previous features were still working during development.
    Also to ensure that every release had the tests passing, the project was integrated in Travis's Continuous Integration\footnote{Travis: \url{http://travis-ci.org}} system: \\
    \indent \url{http://travis-ci.org/carsy/rama-spotify}.

    This way, after every push of a new release, the project gets built and the unit tests run automatically. \\

    The solution was also submitted to validation several times during its development.
    After each release, a constant small group of alpha-testers (3 people) reviewed the state of the application.
    Their feedback would be carried over to the next release: bug fixes, improvements, etc.
    This was the testing cycle that allowed to validate the implemented features.
    To help with this iterative process the issue tracking system of Github\footnote{Github: \url{http://github.com}} was used: \url{https://github.com/carsy/rama-spotify/issues}.
    Given this iterative process of implementation and feedback, the solution would be better prepared for future beta-testing.

\section{Validation} % (fold)
\label{sec:validation}

  In order to validate the proposed method, user tests were done with regular Spotify users and non-Spotify users.
  They represent the second group of testers and will be referred as the beta-testers.

  \subsection{User Tests} % (fold)
  \label{sub:user_tests}

    The proposed application is targeted at Spotify users.
    However, non-Spotify users also tested RAMA's Spotify Application after a few moments of using Spotify's Desktop Client.
    During the test, the user was asked to first use Spotify only.
    The task was to find a couple of new artists that the user liked.
    This first task should take no more than a few minutes, depending on the user.
    The next task was to open the RAMA application and do the same (again this should be completed in a short period of time).
    Given this, the user is forced to compare the two approaches: discovering new music with Spotify only, and discovering new music with RAMA's Spotify Application.

    The objectives of the experiment were to assess some aspects of the application:

    \begin{description}
      \item[User Experience]
        Was the user able to discover new music easily?
      \item[Interface's intuitiveness/design]
        Were all of the application's components (buttons, controls, etc) easy to use? well placed?
    \end{description}

    After the test, the user filled a short questionnaire about the experiment, which contained the following questions:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Are you a Spotify user?
      \item Did the RAMA application help you discover new interesting artists?
      \item Do you think you would use the application to discover new music?
      \item Was the application well integrated with Spotify?
    \end{enumerate}

    Also in the end, the user was encouraged to leave suggestions/feedback or comments about the application.

  \subsection{Data Analysis} % (fold)
  \label{sub:data_analysis}

    A total of 21 beta-testers participated in the experiment.

    \subsubsection{Question 1: Are you a Spotify user?} % (fold)
    \label{ssub:question_1}

      This question was meant to establish the user's experience with Spotify.
      The results can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:question1}.

      \begin{table}[H] % "this is a very good cross-section of users over categories"?
         \begin{center}
           \begin{tabular}{l|c}
       
           \hline
           \textbf{Answer} & \textbf{Nº of responses} \\
           \hline

           \hline
              Yes, I use it as my main way to listen to music & 6 \\
              Yes, I use it from time to time & 4 \\
              No, but I have used/tried it at least once & 5 \\
              No, this is my first time using it & 6 \\
           \hline
           \end{tabular}
         \end{center}
         \caption{Results for question 1.}
         \label{tab:question1}
       \end{table}

      This test group is relatively well distributed with 10 Spotify users, and 11 non-Spotify users.

      This information is very important to better understand the user's suggestions that may or may not be related to basic Spotify interactions.
      For example, when a user wants to start a new map with an artist that is not at the moment visible, there two possibilities to do this.
      By searching for the new artist, the user can then drag and drop the artist into the application in the right side menu, or start playing a song from that artist, and then go back to RAMA and click the \emph{new map} button in the artist menu.

      Both ways require the user to search a new artist using Spotify's search bar.
      To regular Spotify users this is a recurrent procedure, but for new Spotify users, it might confuse them to go out of RAMA's application to fetch information.
    
    \subsubsection{Question 2: Did the RAMA application help you discover new interesting artists?}
    \label{ssub:question_2}

      This was a yes or no question: 20 responded "yes", whereas, 1 responded "no".
      It is clear that RAMA's Spotify Application fulfilled the initial purpose of letting the user discover new music.

      Most of the users did not discover new artists before using the \emph{expand} button or the \emph{new map} button.
      The users launched RAMA when listening to a known artist and this meant that, for the most cases, the user already knew most of the similar artists that appeared in the graph.
      Only when the user started to use these action buttons and found out how to progress in discovering new music, it started to get excited to see what new artists were coming.

      %% NOTE move to future work
      % The one user that did not find new music, did not notice the action buttons.
      % This indicates that the buttons maybe should placed somehow near the artist node, and not on the artist menu.
      % Furthermore, additional improvements to the choice of artists to include in the graph might be required in order to try and impress the user right from the start.

    \subsubsection{Question 3: Do you think you would use the application to discover new music?}
    \label{ssub:question_3}

      This is the principal question used to determine if users felt that RAMA was a usable way of discovering new music within Spotify.

      \begin{table}[H]
         \begin{center}
           \begin{tabular}{l|c}
       
           \hline
           \textbf{Answer} & \textbf{Nº of responses} \\
           \hline

           \hline
            Yes, this is what Spotify is missing! & 6 \\
            Yes, sometimes it's nice to see this visual representation & 15 \\
            No, it does not add much to Spotify & 0 \\
            No, I wouldn't use it. I like Spotify the way it is & 0 \\
           \hline
           \end{tabular}
         \end{center}
         \caption{Results for question 3.}
         \label{tab:question3}
       \end{table}

      The results indicate that the visual representation is indeed a very useful feature.
      Although the majority of the users do not find it to be an essential feature that Spotify is missing, they still think it serves as a good helper to discover new music.

      Given how different the listening habits of users can be, RAMA might be or might not be an appropriate tool for them: some users like to just have an automatic generated playlist playing in the background, while others might like to listen to an artist's albums in sequence.

      % NOTE too much speculation? find refs?
      The first category of users are more adventurous when discovering new music and may not care much about what artists they are listening to, while the latter ones are more conservative and may feel very strong about the music artists they like.
      These are two extreme cases, but it may play a huge role in the user experience of RAMA: users that relate more to the adventurous type, may not feel that the graph is the best way to discover new music and may ask, for example, for a way to select multiple artists to generate an automatic playlist; whereas users that relate more to the conservative type, may be very pleased with RAMA's concept.


    \subsubsection{Question 4: Was the application well integrated with Spotify?}
    \label{ssub:question_4}

      In a scale of 1 to 5, given 1 to be "I felt the app was out of place" and 5 to be "I felt the app was part of Spotify", the users were asked to grade the application's integration into Spotify.

      \begin{table}[hb]
        \begin{center}
          \begin{tabular}{c|c}

            \hline
            \textbf{Answer} & \textbf{Nº of responses} \\
            \hline
            1 & 0 \\
            2 & 1 \\
            3 & 1 \\
            4 & 6 \\
            5 & 13 \\
            \hline
          \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        \caption{Results for question 4.}
        \label{tab:question4}
       \end{table}

      The majority of the users felt that the application was part of Spotify.
      These results indicate that the developed prototype blends very well with Spotify's Desktop Client.
      This is a very important indicator for evaluating the application's integration into Spotify's environment since it plays a major role in defining how good is RAMA in terms of user experience.

      The user that classified with 2 points was not able to create a new map from an artist that was not visible in the graph although it was a regular Spotify user.
      This might indicate that the current way of performing this action is not very intuitive.
  
  % subsection data_analysis (end)

  \subsection{Summary}

    Overall, the results of the experiments were very positive and the users were very impressed with this new way of discovering new music within Spotify.
    Some functionalities still need to be polished in order to create an even more improved user experience, but RAMA's concept implemented within Spotify worked very well for the majority of the users.
