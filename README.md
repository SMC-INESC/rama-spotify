RAMA - Relational Artist MAps
=========

Spotify App

RAMA is a Spotify Application for visualizing and interacting with networks of music artists. For the original RAMA web application see [rama.inescporto.pt]

For now, I do not intend to make this application available on the Spotify App Store, so to run it you need to set it up first.


Installation
--------------

### Mac

Run the following commands from the command prompt (for *nix):
```sh
mkdir ~/Spotify ; cd ~/Spotify
git clone https://github.com/carsy/rama-spotify.git
```

Now open Spotify and type in the search bar:
```sh
spotify:app:rama-spotify
```

You should now be in the app and seeing a graph thingy.

### Windows
If you happen to have commandlinephobia:

1. download the app from [here]
2. extract and rename the folder to "rama-spotify"
3. copy the folder to the Spotify folder that should be in your documents folder (create it if it does not exist yet.)

Now open Spotify and type in the search bar:
```sh
spotify:app:rama-spotify
```

You should now be in the app and seeing a graph thingy.



Version
----

0.1.0

It is still in alfa, so please bear with the lack of functionalities.
